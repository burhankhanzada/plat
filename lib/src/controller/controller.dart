/// listeners on every change. It also tracks undo / redo history (capped by
/// [PlatController.new]'s `undoLimit`) and a most-recently-focused leaf list
/// (capped by `recentLimit`).
///
/// ```dart
/// final controller = PlatController(
///   initialPlat: .tabs(
///     [.leaf(id: 'main.dart', title: 'main.dart')],
///     id: 'editors',
///   ),

///
/// controller
///   ..insertTab(
///     tabGroupId: 'editors',
///     tab: .leaf(id: 'readme', title: 'README.md'),
///   )

/// ```
///
/// State observation is split between cheap id-based queries
/// ([focusedLeafId], [focusedTabGroupId], [maximizedId], [firstTabGroupId],
/// [activeTabId], [nextTabGroupId], [contains], [pathTo],
/// [tabGroupContaining], [parentOf]), and immutable snapshot reads
/// ([root], [snapshot], [focusedLeaf]).
///
/// Mutations come in three flavours:
///
/// - **Recorded** mutations push an undo entry. Most do, including
///   [insertTab], [insertSplitChild], [setSlotChild], [close],
///   [insertTabBeside], [insertTabIntoSlot], [moveTab],
///   [moveTabBeside], [moveTabIntoSlot], [reorderTab], [remove],
///   [resizeSplit], [setSize], [split], [splitActiveTab], [setPinned],
///   [setLocked], [setPreview], and [replace].
/// - **Transient** mutations don't, because they're routinely flipped
///   back: [focus], [setMaximized], and [setTabBarSide].
/// - **Grouped** mutations bundle a sequence into a single undo entry
///   via [transaction].
